Taking on the challenge of Image Processing, we have come up with an algorithm to extract the details of products in shelves using just the smartphone camera. This will help the sales representatives to monitor erroneous labelling and verify the recommended price in the market of the SKU. The solution is in form of an Android app which will give real-time feedback to the representative. Extending the solution, we have developed a baseline to enhance complete consumer experience around shelves using Augmented Reality. The user walks into a store, scans any product and is shown personalised content in an interactive way. This can be used for one to one promotions hence boosting the sales of a product. Moreover, useful information like calorie count, user reviews, sales curves which are not visible directly can be easily shown. An enthusiastic consumer won't have to spend time Googling those details. - Our solution requires minimalistic hardware (just a smartphone with a camera) and offers real-time feedback and interaction. - The consumer analytics data can be further used to monitor the consumers and making better strategies to boost the revenue.
